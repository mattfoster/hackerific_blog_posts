Whilst I was experimenting with [Terminal.app](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/unix/ "Apple") for my previous post, I found that by creatively remapping the `home` and `end` keys, I could circumvent one of the most annoying problems with running [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/ "The MathWorks  - MATLAB and Simulink for Technical Computing") in a terminal: the fact that you move around using normal keys.

This isn't worth writing a big post about, but here's the low-down:
Rempap `home` to read: `\001` and `end` to read `\005`, and you should be sorted. I've tried to remap some other key shortcuts, but I haven't had any luck yet. 

You can find my terminal settings (exported from the toobar at the bottom of the list of profiles at: [MATLAB.terminal]("http://files.my-mili.eu/MATLAB.terminal").
