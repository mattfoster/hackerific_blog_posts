Every now and again I see something which puts me in my place. I don't mean 
in a "I'm a total fool", way, but rather a "Wow! That is hardcore." way. 
I'm put in my place because I see just how much _better_ someone is at something than me. 

The last time this happened was when I watched the TextMate screencast on [tm_dialog](http://macromates.com/screencast/intro_to_tm_dialog.mov). Watch it, it's cool, and makes me glad I paid my â‚¬19!
