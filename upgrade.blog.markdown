Title: Upgrading to 5.04
Format: markdown
Tags: maintainance, upgrade, theme

I've just upgraded my typo install to what will hopefully soon be 5.04 (SVN head), and it seems to have broken my theme (and the themes admin page). Stay tunes whilst I try to restore normality!

Once I get everything working, I'll be sure to post what I had to do!
